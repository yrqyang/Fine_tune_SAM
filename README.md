# Finetuning the SAM model For Road Segmentation

In this project, a SAM-based model was finetuned using the `vit_h` type pretrained SAM model.

## Installation

To run the script to train the model, 

## Usage
* Change the paths of dataset in main.py to the real data paths.

* Modify the model saving path in main.py to the desired directory

* Change the model type and other learning parameters in config.py, if necessary

* Run main.py to train the SAM, and the fine-tuned model will be saved in the given saving path

* Example of Road Segmentation are in the notebook `Road_Segmentation.ipynb`
